				<h3>Known technologies</h3>
				<article>
					<div class='techs'>
						<p>
							<a>C++ programming language</a><br>
							<span>
								Currently in my work for SW development I use pure C++ without any compiler-specific extensions and with many elements of modern C++20.<br>
								For FW development I use truncated C++11 without standard library.<br>
								I work with xt-clang++ (FW), gcc++ (Linux SW), MSVC (Windows SW) compilers.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<a>C programming language</a><br>
							<span>
								On my previous job position I used C with extensions for Linux.<br>
								I worked with gcc compiler.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<a>Python programming language</a><br>
							<span>
								It's my personal choice to know Python3.<br>
								In work I use it to write building pipeline in Conan package manager.<br>
								In my previous work I used it to develop testing framework based on PyTest.<br>
								I like Python for its syntax' simplicity and bright future.<br>
								Programming workshops I conducted were devoted to learning Python.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<a>Git version control system</a><br>
							<span>
								One of my favourite and fundamental tools.<br>
								I use Git on daily basis.<br>
								Keeping commits' history clean and readable is what I stick to.<br>
								Colleagues recognize my compilable, atomic commits and descriptive messages.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<a>Conan package manager</a><br>
							<span>
								One of tools I learnt last year.<br>
								Really helpful package manager for C++ that allows to download ready-to-use libraries.<br>
								I develop CI/CD pipeline for many architectures that uses Conan to build and export libraries.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<a>Xtensa framework</a><br>
							<span>
								Big set of tools for C++, especially for low-level code.<br>
								I use it mainly with its CLI but IDE Xtensa Xplorer is known to me as well.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<a>CMake tool</a><br>
							<span>
								Next tool that simplify maintenance, building and deployment of C++ code.<br>
								Currently in my work it's used in conjunction with Conan.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<a>QuickBuild continuous integration environment</a><br>
							<span>
								I know it as environment accessible from browser for developers to run e.g. testing or deployment configurations<br>
								Each configuration has a lot of options that can be inherited or copied.<br>
								It's huge, complicated system that uses Groovy scripting language for own cross-platform purposes.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<a>Bash and Command Prompt shell scripting languages</a><br>
							<span>
								I know some fundamental syntax and operations.<br>
								Mostly I just use help for commands I want to use.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<a>JSON, Yaml, Doxygen, Markdown and HTML descriptive languages</a><br>
							<span>
								As developer I need to know more than programming or scripting languages and here they are: helper languages.<br>
								They're helpful when I want to write some configuration, print out some dictionary (map) or write some formatted documentation.
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<a>Windows and Linux Operating Systems</a><br>
							<span>
								Currently I develop mostly on Windows and for Windows but product I work on need to be checked on Ubuntu too.<br>
								In previous project I worked on Linux only (Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS).
								Also, environment without OS is target of my current work as well.
